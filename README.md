This is an attempt to solve the Clipboard Landing Page challenge.

I did some modifications and customization like adding circled containers for the social media icons and adding a dark theme. I also added a little bit of text shadow for the sections' texts.

It's not perfectly built tho, because I did some hacky and unnecessary stuff that I later realized it can be done better. But anyway, I'm pretty happy with the result.

Do hope for getting some feedback!
